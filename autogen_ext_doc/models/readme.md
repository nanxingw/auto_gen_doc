```

## Files

### `__init__.py`

This file initializes the `models` package.

### `_base_model.py`

This file contains the base class for all model clients.

#### Classes

- **BaseModelClient**: An abstract base class that defines the interface for all model clients. It includes methods for creating and managing model interactions.

#### Methods

- `create`: Abstract method to create a model interaction.
- `delete`: Abstract method to delete a model interaction.
- `update`: Abstract method to update a model interaction.

### `openai_model.py`

This file contains the implementation of the OpenAI model client.

#### Classes

- **OpenAIModelClient**: A class that extends `BaseModelClient` to provide an interface for interacting with OpenAI models. It includes methods for creating, deleting, and updating model interactions using the OpenAI API.

#### Methods

- `create`: Creates a model interaction using the OpenAI API.
- `delete`: Deletes a model interaction using the OpenAI API.
- `update`: Updates a model interaction using the OpenAI API.

### `custom_model.py`

This file contains the implementation of a custom model client.

#### Classes

- **CustomModelClient**: A class that extends `BaseModelClient` to provide an interface for interacting with custom models. It includes methods for creating, deleting, and updating model interactions using a custom API.

#### Methods

- `create`: Creates a model interaction using the custom API.
- `delete`: Deletes a model interaction using the custom API.
- `update`: Updates a model interaction using the custom API.

## Dependencies

- `requests`
- `json`
- `logging`
- `typing`

## Conclusion

The `models` directory provides various implementations of model clients, each designed to handle specific types of AI models. By leveraging different clients, this package can interact with OpenAI models, custom models, and more, making it a valuable tool for managing AI model interactions.
