## Subdirectories

### `agents`

The `agents` directory contains various implementations of AI assistant agents designed to provide different functionalities.

#### Subdirectories

- `file_surfer`: Contains the implementation of the `FileSurfer` agent, which acts as a local file previewer.
- `magentic_one`: Contains the implementation of the `MagenticOneCoderAgent`, which provides coding assistance using a language model.
- `openai`: Contains the implementation of the `OpenAIAssistantAgent`, which uses the OpenAI Assistant API to generate responses.
- `web_surfer`: Contains the implementation of the `MultimodalWebSurfer` agent, which interacts with web pages using Playwright.

#### Classes

- **FileSurfer**: An agent that can handle local files, providing functionalities such as opening, reading, and navigating files.
- **MagenticOneCoderAgent**: An agent that provides coding assistance using an LLM model client. It can generate Python and shell scripts to solve various tasks.
- **OpenAIAssistantAgent**: An agent that uses the OpenAI Assistant API to create AI assistants with capabilities like code interpretation, file handling, and custom function calling.
- **MultimodalWebSurfer**: A multimodal agent that acts as a web surfer, capable of performing web searches, visiting web pages, and interacting with content using Playwright.
- **MarkdownFileBrowser**: A class for browsing files in Markdown format, providing functionalities such as opening files, paging, and searching within files.
- **PlaywrightController**: A helper class to allow Playwright to interact with web pages to perform actions such as clicking, filling, and scrolling.
- **WebSurferEvent**: A dataclass that represents events occurring within the `MultimodalWebSurfer` agent.

#### Dependencies
